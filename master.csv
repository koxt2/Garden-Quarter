Myself and my family have attended events such as worship , drama club , yoga , cinema , children’s activities , wildlife workshops , theatre productions , arts initiatives there . This shows there is a need for this type of facility in our community and that the space is very important for the community . It used to be that the church provided for the community’s needs week in week out - with three well attended services each Sunday providing a focal point for community gatherings, spiritual and moral well being and support . Society has shifted and although people still have the same needs for community , togetherness, music , warmth and support people no longer find this on a Sunday in a formal church service In the numbers they used to . So a wider variety of activities are needed to make sure people’s mental health and need for community is met - particularly given the huge chasms of inequality and mental health issues which are now more prevalent in our country than ever. Both of these issues have community disconnection and alienation at their heart . The govt is providing less and less as the state shrinks back - and this requires individuals  and communities to step up to look after ourselves . We need spaces to do this . The community NEEDS this space as a hub and it would Be a Devastating loss if the Community could no longer use it .

 I don’t particularly have a vision for how the building needs to change physically to allow this development but would be really interested to see others ideas to inspire me . Whatever changes take place we should respect the original sacred nature of the space As much as possible whilst also allowing its future multi purpose development . It is possible and important to do both . The chapel has a wonderful atmosphere of inclusivity that has community at its heart which can be celebrated and extended so everyone can feel the special nature of this space in a way they is supportive and meaningful to them personally .

I’ve seen this in other areas such as Hoole. Having kitchen facilities and/or a cafe greatly improves the potential for functions and gatherings. Having as large a function space as possible, with scope to zone the space into smaller areas (eg screens or accordion style doors) means it is much more adaptable esp with social distancing or sessions involving movement etc. I would love to have a semi regular market or a fix it group or leisure groups running from this space. A cafe that has a free play area would be an easy place for me to meet friends who are parents. Maybe the cafe could be run as a social enterprise ? 
It would be great to still use the space for community activities such as meetings and consultations with the council, drop off for the food bank etc. Car parking would need to be taken into account. 
I would welcome opportunity to hire the space for occasional classes I run or for music rehearsal space.
